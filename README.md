# COVID-19-Hospitalization-Management-System
With the massive amount of COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds, the purpose of the database is
to collect health information of inpatients, improve prognosis, modify treatment strategies, and adjust
admission standards in order to manage COVID-19 patients more efficiently. This database will be used
by both physicians and hospital administrative staff.

## Mission Objectives
1. Provide patients’ information to physicians to give appropriate treatments and further reduce the COVID-19 death rate.
2. Allow medical care providers to record and compare different treatment results, which helps to further improve treatment strategies.
3. Ensure that physicians can identify the severity of the disease through clinical symptoms and examinations and further adjust admission standards to better control the number of COVID-19 inpatients. 
4. Allow administrative staff to collect patients’ treatment-related information and generate descriptive patient reports.  
5. Ensure that administrative staff are able to assign available beds immediately for COVID-19 patients.
6. Supply information to improve the scheduling of admission and discharge, and to allocate scarce medical resources more fairly for COVID-19 patients.
7. Permit administrative staff to track the geographical distribution of COVID-19 patients to prevent the spread.
