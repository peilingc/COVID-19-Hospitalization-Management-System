# COVID-19-Hospitalization-Management-System
With the massive amount of COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds, the purpose of the database is
to collect health information of inpatients, improve prognosis, modify treatment strategies, and adjust
admission standards in order to manage COVID-19 patients more efficiently. This database will be used
by both physicians and hospital administrative staff.
