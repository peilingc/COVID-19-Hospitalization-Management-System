# COVID-19-Hospitalization-Management-System
With the massive amount of COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds, the purpose of the database is
to collect health information of inpatients, improve prognosis, modify treatment strategies, and adjust
admission standards in order to manage COVID-19 patients more efficiently. This database will be used
by both physicians and hospital administrative staff.

# Mission Objectives
1. Track patients' addresses to send alerts and prevent community spread. 
2. Improve the scheduling of admission and discharge. 
3. Collect and analyze patients and treatment-related information that allows administrative staff to generate descriptive patients reports.
4. Allow medical care providers to compare treatment results, which helps to further modify treatment strategies. 
5. Determine examinations and treatments that patients need based on clinical symptoms.
